## 1. Components and Their Usage:

While creating the interface, some UI components should be used to make the design of the website. And these components are:

1. Text Fields
2. Buttons
3. Checkboxes
4. List boxes
5. Tables
   

**- Text Fields**

To get the information from the user such as username, phone, email and the actual name, text fields must be used. It will get the text from the box and save it to the table with the buttons.

**- Buttons**

After all the things done in text fields, Using a button named 'Save user' will save the user information to the table. If there is a need to add a new user to the table, then the button 'New User' is used to get write the information about that user.

**- Checkboxes**

While filling out the form of the new user, it will be checked if this user is enabled or not. To add this information, checkboxes should be used. In the contents of the table, there might be a checkbox named 'hide disabled user' to separate them.

**- List boxes**

What is the role of the user? To declare it, list box will be needed into creating new user interface. According to the choice of the new user, it will store the data into the table.

**- Tables**

After all the criterias done, new user will be added to data of the website and to contain all of the information about the user, table must be used. With that, the manager can access and check the available user.

## 2. Requirements:

This application must be secure and easy to navigate between frames. Security is a must to protect the data of the users.

In addition, the designation of the application can be attractive in proper colors. Flashy colors must be avoided in order to create a good looking and eye friendly application. Text labels need to be in a good font for every user. To make it more attractive, icons can be used too.

Lastly, for the users, it should be easy to use and it shouldn't contain too much detail to make the user confused.

## 3. Design of the Interface:

There can be one frame or two frames while using the components above. If it will be one frame, the table of the registered users and textfields will be side to side each other. When the user clicks 'New User' button, textfields and the other components will be displayed and after everything is done, data of the new users will be added to the users table with 'Save User' button.

Otherwise, if it will be designed as two frames, one frame will contain the table while the other one will contain. BUttons will be used as a navigation between frames. 'New User' button will open the user interface frame and after the informations are done, with 'Save User' button, contents will be added and to see the content of the table, a new button named 'Display Table' might be used to navigate this frames easily.
